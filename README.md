### Conway's Game of Life 

##### The Game Of Life was developed by John Conway as a way to show that simple rules can lead to complex interaction. More information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

##### The goal of this application is to provide the code for the game, to allow users to play with these rules and experiement with the possible interaction. Running the code in fairly simple:
1) Import the code using <code>from gol import Game_Of_Life as gol</code>
